Data Structures Projects:  

1. Use existing BellmanFord, Dijkstra for Shortest Path and Prims Kruskal for Mininmum Spanning Tree codes with 4 properties, (https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/)

2. Perform experiments on a dataset, and 

3. Report the results in the three assignments (original). 

4. Describe graph dataset (about name and relationship between vertices and edges) provided in the reference paper.

5. Describe data structure or algorithm (about technique or approach used to process the data) in the reference paper. 

6. Describe what is the  useful and novel idea in the reference.

7. Describe the experimentations, results, observations, findings, inferences generated in the reference paper. 

8. Describe the Pros-Cons (i.e. benefits, limitations) of the work in the reference paper.   

9. Citation of the Reference (use Cite in Google Scholar).

10. Project algorithm code used for the experimentation on the dataset of reference paper.

11. Algo must be from https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/ Mention (Name, Link, Purpose of the Algorithm)

12. Project results generated from the experiments using the algorithm on the dataset of reference paper.

13. How your results of project experiments are different from the results of the reference paper.
