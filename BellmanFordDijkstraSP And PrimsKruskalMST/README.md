9. Citation of the Reference (use Cite in Google Scholar).
10. Project algorithm code used for the experimentation on the dataset of reference paper.
11. Algo must be from https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/ Mention (Name, Link, Purpose of the Algorithm)
12. Project results generated from the experiments using the algorithm on the dataset of reference paper.
13. How your results of project experiments are different from the results of the reference paper. 

# Semester-long plan: 
Make a group of minimum 3 students to maximum 5 students, this group will work together for the whole semester. The whole work will be evaluated once a group project. At the end of the semester, there are three assignments that will be submitted by a group. 
Assignment 1: Report
Assignment 2: PPT
Assignment 3: Video presentation
Later, I will share Google-Form for submitting these three assignments.
We will discuss this in detail in the next class or lab. 

# Weekly-lab plan:
# Lab 1: Install IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans etc. Configure Java in the Operating system. 
https://www.eclipse.org/
https://www.java.com/en/download/
Run Hello World program. https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11hello/HelloWorld.java.html   
Done

# Lab 2: Read and understand the basics about Graph theory.
Run few codes of https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/40graphs/
Done

# Lab3: Select a few datasets from the SNAP https://snap.stanford.edu/data/
Apply a few basic algorithms of Graph https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/40graphs/
Currently, it is not expected to be proficient in all this. Just keep on following and reading the links and instructions shared. In long term, you will learn how Code and Data Structures works together.

# Lab 4: To keep symmetry, select anyone of the following network data from the link: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/
Social networks : online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
Web graphs : nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
Wikipedia networks, articles, and metadata : talk, editing, voting, and article data from Wikipedia
Temporal networks : networks where edges have timestamps

# Lab 5: 
1. Each team will Download and Study a network data from the 6 categories given in previous Lab 4. 
- https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ 
- Categories: Social networks, Citation networks, Collaboration networks, Web graphs, Wikipedia networks, and Temporal networks.

2. Each member will read and understand the paper and approach for the dataset your team has downloaded. Note do not download a dataset, which does not have a research paper connected to it.

3. Each team will make a ppt based presentation, which will help you in final submissions.

# Lab 6: Fill the from https://forms.gle/NBmPiaCXaGg8DUhK6
Keep on updating and improving the form for the whole semesters
Final submission will be in the last week before End-term exams.
Final evaluation will happen in the last week before the End-term exams. 


# Lab 7: How to report the experiment results after running the code on the computer.
 
Create a Table with 4 properties × 4 algorithms. Write all 16 values after calculation, which is discussed in the class.

Make the above table for two case-studies.
Case 1: Demo the table for the Example graphs (G1, G2, G3) given in the Q5 of Mid-term. For simplicity, treat the three G1, G2, G3 as Undirected graphs. The 4 properties are Mean (Average), Median, Minimum, and Maximum. The 4 algorithms are Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, Bellman-ford's.    
Case 2: Demo the table for the Dataset written in the Q1 of Mid-term. If the dataset has undirected-graphs making multi-graphs or evolving-graphs, then repeat the above 4 properties and 4 algorithms. Else, for the single graph, choose the 4 properties and 4 algorithms, but all this need to make sense; such group can switch to multi-graphs ore evolving-graphs. 
Visual analytics and summarizations will be appreciated.

# Lab 8: Start filling the form and start preparing three assignments: write-up report (2 pages only), ppts, video presentation (10 minutes).

For the public dataset of the project.

- Full-flexibility to chose the 4 algorithms and 4 properties, which make sense for your dataset. 
- Full-flexibility to demonstrate table of any size. Means, table is not fixed to 4  × 4 × 2 entries.

However,  the 4  × 4 × 2 entries will be fixed for the Q5 Mid-term example (treat it as undirected or directed as per the requirement).

- Suggestion for better report and presentation:
1. Plot a time-series plot on sensible for X-axis and Y-axis. 
2. The time-series should generate sensible observations and findings.


# Lab 9: Continue with same 4 algo with 4 properties
1. Use existing 4 codes with 4 properties, (https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/)
2. Perform experiments on a dataset, and 
3. Report the results in the three assignments (original). 
Do not use available text and content. Final submission date and evaluation will be done one week prior to the End-term exams.	

# Lab 10: 
For better presentation 
Input: Use Switch-case or If-else to prompt user and chosen by the user. Use hierarchy of Problem then possible ways to solve it on terminal. Write name and describe (1 or 2 lines) its data structure used in the code on the terminal. Use may use different data structure to execute the code for same problem.

Output: Present some basic Visualization of the result. For example, use Excel graph-plot to present visual graphs and figures.
