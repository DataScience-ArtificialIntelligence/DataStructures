Data Structures Assignments:  

1. Use existing data structures codes for Student information storage management. 
Write name and describe (1 or 2 lines) its data structure used in the code on the terminal. 

2. Execute the codes of Data Structures like (Linked-List, Sort, Stack, Queue, Tree-Traversal, etc), and 

As discussed in the Linked-list slides build
3. Data structures for Students similar to slides (create, traverse, insert, delete) .

3. In the last slides
Write a function to:
3a) Concatenate two given list into one big list. 
node *concatenate (node *head1, node *head2);

3b) Insert an element in a linked list in sorted order. The function will be called for every element to be inserted.
void insert_sorted (node **head, node *element);

3c) Always insert elements at one end, and delete elements from the other end (first-in first-out QUEUE).
void insert_q (node **head, node *element)
node *delete_q (node **head) /* Return the deleted node */

4. Report the results in the two assignments (original).

5. Explain the input and output of the Data structure codes
